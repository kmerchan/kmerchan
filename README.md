## About Me
Hi!  I'm Kelsie Merchant. Through earning a B.S. in Engineering Physics from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/), I developed a passion for breaking complex concepts into simple explanations, problem-solving, and analyzing data to optimize processes.  I was able to practice these skills through several research projects at Mines and an internship as a Photolithography Process Engineer at [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/) Semiconductor Manufacturing.  Throughout my Physics work, I noticed the huge benefit technology can have in driving science forward.  I hope to bridge the divide between science and tech to engineer better solutions, so I continued my education to learn Software Engineering at [Holberton Tulsa](https://www.holbertonschool.com/).  I am currently studying Machine Learning and will be graduating in September 2021.
